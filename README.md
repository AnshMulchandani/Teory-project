ðŸ§  Teory-Project: Educational Website on LLMs
ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project is part of a collaborative group practice focused on building an educational website about Large Language Models (LLMs). Following the official assignment structure, we used Visual Studio Code, GitHub, GitHub Copilot, and GitHub Actions to design and develop a responsive, interactive website that explains what LLMs are, how they work, and their societal impact.

The website includes:

A clear and modern layout

Responsive CSS styling

JavaScript-powered interactivity (e.g., dynamic fun facts and table toggle)

Educational content and ethical considerations

GitHub Actions automation with ESLint for code quality

All team members followed the collaborative workflow outlined in the assignment: creating personal branches, developing independently, reviewing via Pull Requests, and merging through an assigned integrator.

Team Roles and Contributions
- Ansh Mulchandani
Repository Owner: Created the GitHub repository and personal branch Ansh-Mulchandani-Poptani

LLM Content Writer: Provided the educational text inside the HTML

DevOps Manager: Set up GitHub Actions with an ESLint configuration to ensure code quality

Final Integrator: Reviewed and merged team contributions into the main branch

Collaboration: Communicated with ChatGPT to suggest improvements and finalized the project report

- AdriÃ  CortÃ©s
HTML Layout Designer: Built the full structure of index.html with all required sections

CSS Designer: Styled the website with a modern and visually attractive layout, responsive design, and theme customization

JavaScript Developer: Implemented dynamic functionality in app.js, including fun fact rotation, table toggle, and user interactions

Implementation: Followed ChatGPT-guided development with additional self-directed improvements and refinements

We followed a collaborative workflow using Git and GitHub, where each of us created a personal branch to work independently on our assigned tasks. This allowed us to develop and test our contributions without affecting the main codebase. Once ready, we pushed our changes and opened pull requests for peer review. This process helped us avoid conflicts, ensured code quality through GitHub Actions, and made integration smooth and organized. Working with branches improved our coordination and gave us a clear structure for collaboration.
